If you need to "favorite" content blocks, you can use the bookmark function. Because all note content is based on content blocks, we can not only collect documents (document blocks), but also various types of content blocks.
{: id="20200924100646-fho5tti"}

## Collection of non-document blocks
{: id="20200924100646-n5mdlhy"}

In the editor, move the mouse to the block identifier on the left side of the content block and click to display a drop-down menu. After selecting the bookmark, the block can be added to the favorite.
{: id="20200924100646-n3b28o0"}

## Collection document block
{: id="20200924100646-b4gv4qp"}

There are two ways to bookmark documents:
{: id="20200924100646-pznqy8r"}

* Right-click on the document tab to display a drop-down menu
* Select a document in the file tree, right-click on the document and a drop-down menu will appear
{: id="20200924100646-mp598ly"}
