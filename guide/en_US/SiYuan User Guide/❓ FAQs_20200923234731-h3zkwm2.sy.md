## How to insert a picture?
{: id="20200923234759-9cpb9vp"}

You can insert a picture through the Markdown picture syntax `![optional picture description text](picture file path)`. You can also directly drag the image file into the editor to insert it, and the image file will be automatically copied to the assets folder at the same level of the document.

## How to insert video and audio?

## Where are the configuration files stored?
{: id="20200923234759-o0xdag0"}

The default configuration files are saved in the user's home folder `~/.siyuan/`, you can specify the path of the configuration file storage folder through ((20200924100717-yzwzn64 "startup parameter")).

If you need to share the configuration on multiple devices, you can synchronize the configuration folder through a third-party network disk service.
