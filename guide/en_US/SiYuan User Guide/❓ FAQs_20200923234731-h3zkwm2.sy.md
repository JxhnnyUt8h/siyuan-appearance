## How to insert a picture?
{: id="20200923234759-9cpb9vp"}

You can insert a picture through the Markdown picture syntax `![optional picture description text](picture file path)`. You can also directly drag the image file into the editor to insert it, and the image file will be automatically copied to the assets directory at the same level of the document.

## How to insert video and audio?
{: id="20200923234759-8au5cfc"}

## Where is the configuration file directory?
{: id="20200923234759-o0xdag0"}

By default, all configuration file directories are in the user's home directory (`~/.siyuan/`), and the configuration file directory path can be specified through ((20200828105441-r76vmu5 "Startup Parameters")).

If you need to share the configuration on multiple devices, you can synchronize the configuration directory through a third-party network disk service.
